This repo will store my work and progress for building a website to display data from the NASA CAD API. This project is being created as part of CSPB3122 Professional Development

## Update 9/18/2024
Instructions for accessing the NASA SBDB Close Approach Database are listed at [(https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/cad.html)] 
I have imported some older projects where I used similar skills in order to reference them for this project.
